HERE I HAVE IMPLEMENTED RAG AND WEB SCRAPPING FROM AMAZON TO CREATE THIS SOFTWARE WHICH WILL FETCH ME INFO IN REALTIME.WHY? THIS WILL REDUCE THE HELUCINATION THAT OCCUR DUE TO THE LLM HAVING NO RELAVENT INFORMATION ON THAT PARTICULAR TOPIC.

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a cutting-edge AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware responses.

LLMs hallucinate because they predict text statistically based on patterns in their training data rather than accessing ground truth, prioritizing fluent responses over factual accuracy. LLMs are like "stochastic parrots"â€”they mimic patterns without understanding truth. Techniques like RAG, better training data, and human-in-the-loop verification help mitigate hallucinations
